# Blockly Extended Music Project

In this repo some additional blocks for contemporary music education are shown. 
The template is taken from the getting-started example template of Blockly.

## Fase 1

At this moment a definition of all the required blocks is being made. Once all the requirements are gathered it will be possible to design the actual code for the creation of sounds.

It has being defined 9 groups of blocks: 

* duration: For blocks describing different ways of expres duration of sounds.
* attack: For blocks describing control over the beginning of different kind of sounds.
* release: For blocks describing control over the ending of different kind of sounds.
* harmonics: For blocks describing control over adding harmonic parts to an electronic sound.
* filtering: For blocks describing control over adding harmonic parts to an electronic sound.
* modulation: For blocks describing how to control various parameters of a sound with basic waveforms.
* speed: For blocks describing different effects of speeding up/down a given recorded sound.
* collages: For blocks describing different effects of cutting and joining different parts of sounds together. 
* effects: For blocks describing different kind of sound effects on a given sound.
